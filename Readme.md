<h1>A bit of cutomization for the termux Bourne Again Shell(BASH), and some easy binaries.sh</h1>

<h2>bash.bashrc</h2>
<p>This here is a little modification to the bash.bashrc file in the /usr/etc/bash.bashrc. Enjoy tweaking with these c:
Replace or copy the contents to your usr/etc/bash.bashrc.</p>

<h2>bash.bashrc2 (Inspired by gruvbox colorscheme)</h2>
<p>This bash.bashrc2 is what my bash.bashrc looks like. It's inspired by gruvbox.vim theme from vim editor.Added couple of modifications like changing the default cursor to I-beam and tons of aliases. This theme was inspired by gruvbox theme from vim</p>

<h2>bash.bashrc3(Night Owl colorscheme)</h2>
<p>Yet another update, custom prompts and perhaps a solarized version of my own, Inspired by iceberg.vim and camo.vim theme from vim. I actually made a combination of these 2 colorschemes in my dotfiles/.vimrc and came up with a new colorscheme, and I actually quite like it to be honest.</p>

<h2>bash-scripts</h2>
<p>These simple shell scripts might just make working a lot easier.
Copy these to usr/bin and dont forget to chmod u+x</p>

<h2>.inputrc</h2>
<p>The .inputrc dotfile contains the vi key-bindings for the shell..just copy and paste it to your home(~/) and probably type in termux-reload-settings.</p>

<h2>Color chart</h2>
<p>Also, I've added a 256 color chart to help you better understand what I'm doing here. You can match the color codes with the bash.bashrc files</p>
<h2>Vim Plugins</h2>
<p>My vim plugins are included in the /dotfiles directory</p>
<h2>dotfiles</h2>
<p>The dotfiles contain some config files for my tmux, vim and some key bindings(for vim) I'm using for my bash atm.</p>

## This has been my chronological improvisation of termux colorschemes lol!
## This is inspired by solarized colorscheme of the gnome-terminal
The bash.bashrc for this is located in the dotfiles/bash.bashrc and the colors.properties in dotfiles/.termux/colors.properties. Enjoy tweaking with these
